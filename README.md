## Problem Statement
Farmers in India often face challenges in identifying and tracking their cattle and buffaloes.  
Traditional methods like branding, tagging, or manual monitoring are either inaccurate, costly, or inconvenient.  
This leads to issues in livestock management, breeding, insurance, and overall productivity.

## Proposed Solution
Pashu-Drishti is a **YOLOv8-powered vision system** that can accurately detect and identify different Indian cattle and buffalo breeds.  
The solution is optimized to run on **low-end smartphones**, making it accessible to rural farmers without requiring expensive hardware.

- 🔍 **Identification**: Detects individual cattle & buffalo breeds with high accuracy.  
- 📱 **Lightweight**: Built with **YOLOv8**, and being optimized further with **YOLOv8-nano** for better performance on resource-constrained devices.  
- 🚜 **Farmer-first approach**: Tailored to support livestock owners in rural India.

## Target Audience
👨‍🌾 **Farmers** are the primary beneficiaries of this system.  
It aims to help them in:  
- Tracking livestock efficiently  
- Preventing cattle mix-ups  
- Improving breeding records  
- Facilitating insurance and health monitoring  

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is **self-collected** from Indian farms and cattle shelters, ensuring real-world diversity and applicability.
